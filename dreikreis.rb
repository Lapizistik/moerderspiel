# The popular game MÃ¶rderspiel is played with large number of participants.
# Each player gets assigned a prey (another player) whom he or she has to
# catch. So each player is prey and hunter at the same time.
# The stager has to assure that every player has exactly one prey and
# that each prey has exactly one hunter.
#
# The best case is to have one circle (permutation) of players where every
# player hunts his successor (and the last one hunts the first one).
#
# Such a circle is easy to construct. It gets more difficult if you want to
# include additional constraints:
# - Some of the players know each other and each hunter should go for a
#   prey she does not knod (that does not belong to her group)
# - In some scenarios you want to play in more than one circle simultaniously
#   In this case a hunter shall not have the same prey in different circles
#   (which occours surprisingly often if you create the circles randomly)
#
# This program stages games with three circles which fulfil these constraints
